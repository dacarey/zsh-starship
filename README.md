# zsh-starship
A zsh plugin to manage the Starship prompt

## Install
Using the [:zap: Zap](https://www.zapzsh.org/) minimal zsh plugin manager, add the following to your `.zshrc`

```sh
# Install plugin
plug "dacarey/zsh-starship"
```

## Prerequisite Checks
A check will be performed to verify that `starship` has been installed:

- [`starship`](https://starship.rs/) - The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!


## License
The **zsh-starship** plugin is released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/wintermi/zsh-starship/blob/main/LICENSE) unless explicitly mentioned in the file header.

## Kudos
This is a fork of [winterml's zsh-starship](https://github.com/wintermi/zsh-starship) plugin.

Primarily I forked so that I can maintain my own starship configuration within the plugin
